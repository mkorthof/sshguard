This script lets you generate command backends for sshguard easily.
A command-based backend is one that uses commands for blocking,
releasing, flushing block rules.

I need the following:
 - a name for this backend (choose yourself)
 - [possibly] a command for first inizialization of the backend
 - a command for blocking an address
 - a command for releasing an address
 - a command for flushing the blocked addresses
 - [possibly] a command for last finalization of the backend
These can all be composite with shell operators.
Press enter to continue, Ctrl-C to exit.
